    <h1>HTTP Basics</h1>
    <p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.</p>
    <p>HTTP is a request-response protocol, meaning that a client sends a request to a server, and the server sends back a response.</p>
    <h2>HTTP Request</h2>
    <p>An HTTP request consists of several parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Method - The request method tells the server what kind of request is being sent. Common methods include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.</li>
      <li>URL - The request URL specifies the location of the resource being requested.</li>
      <li>Headers - The request headers contain additional information about the request, such as the client's preferred language and the type of content being sent.</li>
      <li>Body - The request body contains the data being sent to the server. This is typically used in POST and PUT requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>HTTP Response</h2>
    <p>An HTTP response also consists of several parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Status Code - The status code tells the client whether the request was successful or if there was an error. Common status codes include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).</li>
      <li>Headers - The response headers contain additional information about the response, such as the type of content being sent and the length of the response.</li>
      <li>Body - The response body contains the data being sent back to the client. This can be HTML, JSON, XML, or other types of data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>HTTP is a simple yet powerful protocol that allows for the transfer of information between different systems on the internet. It forms the backbone of the World Wide Web and enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>
