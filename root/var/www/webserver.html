      <p>A web server is a computer that stores and delivers web pages to clients over the internet.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>When a client, such as a web browser, requests a web page from a server, the server retrieves the requested page from its file system and sends it back to the client.</p>
      <p>The server uses the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with the client. The client sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server sends back an HTTP response.</p>
      <p>The HTTP request contains information about the requested resource, such as the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and the HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, etc.). The HTTP response contains the requested resource as well as information about the resource, such as the Content-Type and the Content-Length.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>Web servers can also handle dynamic content, which is generated by server-side scripts. For example, a server-side script can retrieve data from a database and generate a web page based on that data.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>In addition to handling requests for web pages, web servers can also handle other types of requests, such as for images, videos, and other files.</p>
      <p>Web servers also use a variety of other technologies to improve performance and security, such as caching, load balancing, and encryption.</p>
