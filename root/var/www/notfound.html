<h1> What is a 404 Page Not Found error? </h1>
<p>
	A 404 Not Found error is an HTTP response status code indicating that the server could not find the requested resource. This error occurs when a client (such as a web browser) tries to access a web page or resource that does not exist on the server. The 404 Not Found error can be triggered for a variety of reasons, including the requested URL being mistyped, the resource being moved or deleted, or the server being temporarily down or undergoing maintenance.
	When a user encounters a 404 Not Found error, they typically see a default error page indicating that the resource they were trying to access could not be found. The error page may also display a message explaining the cause of the error and providing suggestions for what the user can do next, such as searching for the resource on a different page or trying again later.
	In some cases, web developers may choose to customize the 404 Not Found error page to provide a more helpful and user-friendly experience. This can include adding links to other pages on the website, displaying search boxes or categories, or providing contact information for support.
