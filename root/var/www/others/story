Once upon a time, there were three students named Pieter, Marius, and Maria who were studying computer science at a prestigious university. For their final project, they were tasked with building an entire HTTP web server in C++ from scratch.

Pieter was in charge of handling the networking aspect of the project. He was responsible for setting up the server to listen for incoming requests and handling the communication between the client and the server. He was determined to make sure the server was fast and efficient, able to handle multiple requests at the same time.

Marius was the one who took care of the back-end logic. He had to design and implement the algorithms that would process the requests and generate the appropriate responses. He worked tirelessly to make sure the server was secure and that it wouldn't crash under heavy loads.

Maria was the team's front-end expert. She was responsible for designing and implementing the user interface that would display the information from the server. She put a lot of effort into making the interface clean and intuitive, so that users could easily find the information they needed.

The three students worked tirelessly, day and night, for weeks on end, pouring all their knowledge and skills into the project. They encountered many obstacles along the way, but they persevered, always pushing forward and never giving up.

Finally, the day of the presentation arrived. The team stood in front of the class, feeling nervous and excited. They took turns demonstrating their work, showing how the server was able to handle multiple requests and return accurate responses. The class was impressed by the team's hard work and dedication, and they received high marks for their project.
